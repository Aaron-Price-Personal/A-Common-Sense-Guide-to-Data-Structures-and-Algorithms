# A Common-Sense Guide to Data Structures and Algorithms

This is a repo where all my excerises answers from the book are practiced

Most of the code is currently written in python, but will be expanded with java and c if i have time

This repo also allows me to solidify my knowledge with git and GitHub to automate the processes within my brain
